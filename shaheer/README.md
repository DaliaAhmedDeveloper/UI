# Shaheer UI Project

A modern, responsive UI project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Modular CSS and JS
- Ready for integration with backend

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd shaheer
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the main page.

## Folder Structure
